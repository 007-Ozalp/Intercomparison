# S2G : Station to Grid Module for the Intercomparison between EO-Derived Data and In-situ Observationals
The station-to-grid module (s2g.py) is a Python script designed for processing meteorological data, focusing on modularity, reusability, and clarity. 
It effectively handles various data formats, applies necessary conversions, and organizes processed data for subsequent analysis and visualization. 
The primary goal of the s2g.py is to facilitate the efficient handling, processing, and analysis of meteorological datasets. 
It focuses on integrating data from various sources, such as NetCDF and CSV files, and preparing it for further analysis and visualization.
